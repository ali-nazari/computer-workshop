## <a name="Course-Overview"></a>Course Overview:
```javascript
In this course, we try to teach substantial skills required for every undergraduate student. 
It covers fundamental concepts from hardware components to various OSs and their components.
Particularly, command lines and essentials in Linux are taught. 
In the remaing time of the semester, neccessary tips and tricks of must-known tools, such as Office, and web search are considered.
If we have time, Latex and web programming are in our attention.

It is worth mentioning that we explain concepts in the first part of the class 
and practice them in the second part.
